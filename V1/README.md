A fun little computational linguistics project. This is a program that generates semantically nonsensical (potentially, at least!) but syntactically well-formed sentences in the style of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. This could be developed into a Mad Lib style game which would be  
quite fun.  
# POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
Addition of new parts of speech (adverbs, for example)
Either a command-line (argparse) based input method, or a tiny little GUI
